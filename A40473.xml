            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>If a <hi>Praecipe</hi> be brought of a Mannor and 20 s. Rent, it is a good Plea to ſay, that the Rent is parcel of the Mannor.

               <p>In a Writ of Right of Advowſon againſt <hi>A.

               <p>In Aſſiſe it is a good plea to the Writ to ſay that the Plaintiff was ſeiſed of the Freehold of the Lands in the Plaint; but in a Forcible Entry it is no plea to ſay that he was ſeiſed the day that the Writ was purchaſed, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 41.</p>
               <p>Death or Coverture at the time of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the writ, ſhall abate the writ <hi>de facto;</hi> but Coverture afterwards makes it but abateable, 32 <hi>H. 6. 11. 3. Br. 138. Co. Entr. 173. Raſt. Entr.</hi> 107, 108, 126, 161.</p>
               <p>It is no Plea to the Writ to ſay that the Summons were of other Lands, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may wage his Law <hi>de non Sum. 37 H.</hi> 6. 26.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> was brought, and the Plaintiff made his Title to the Advowſon as appendant; The Defendant ſaid, that a Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety was in Groſs, and it was doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>A <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> is brought againſt the Incumbent without naming the Patron (he being alive) this makes the Writ only abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and is not good upon a Writ of Error.</p>
               <p>In a Writ of <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> or other Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Writs, the death of the King before Judgment ſhall abate the Writ <hi>de facto,</hi> but it is otherwiſe where the Defendant dies.

               <p>When the Original bears <hi>Teſte</hi> before the cauſe of Action accrues, the Writ ſhall abate <hi>de facto propter defectum. Anderſon 1. 241. a. 96. Raſt. Entr. 459. Co. Entr. 624. Brown's Entries 1. Part, Tit. Abatement.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Where it appears by the plaintiffs own ſhewing that he had not an Action for the whole, or for part, the Writ ſhall abate <hi>de</hi>

               <p>Some Pleas abate the Writ in the whole, and ſome but in part. As,</p>

Raſt. Entr.</hi> 126.</p>
               <p>Treſpaſs againſt husband and wife, after Verdict and before the day in Bank the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dyes, in <hi>Cro. Caroli</hi> 509. it is doubted, if the writ ſhall abate; but it is agreed there, That if the wife dyes it ſhall not abate againſt the husband. But in caſe for Slander by the wife the writ ſhall abate after Verdict. <hi>Heb.</hi> 129.</p>
               <p>Account againſt two, one dyes after the firſt Judgment, the Writ ſhall abate only againſt him.</p>
               <p>In Right of Advowſon the Defendant pleads that the Plaintiff was ſeiſed of the ſixth part <hi>die impetrationis brevis,</hi> this ſhall abate the whole Writ, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
               <p>In Debt upon an Obligation, the defendant pleads, That after the writ purchaſed, the plaintiff had received parcel, and ſhews an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64030:7"/> Acquittance, the whole writ ſhall abate; and yet it is a good plea in barr for that part. 5 <hi>H. 7. 41. a. Raſt. Entr. 160. 7 E. 4. 19. 15 H. 7. 10. 3 H.</hi> 7. 3. Quere if in Debt upon ſimple Contract the plaintiff receives part <hi>pendente brevi,</hi> if it ſhall abate the writ.</p>

               <p>If an Infant Lets Lands for a Term of years rendring Rent, he may at his Election have an Action of Debt for the Rent reſerved upon the Leaſe, or bring Treſpaſs for oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupying of the Land; and ſo he may have an Action of Treſpaſs for the uſe of of a thing ſold by him. And if an infant do give an Horſe to one without actual delivery of the Horſe into his hands at the time of the gift, and the Donee taketh the Horſe by reaſon of the gift, the Infant may have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt him. 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2.

               <p>Where a Leaſe for years is made by Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, of the Lands of the Wife, rendring Rent, the Action of Debt muſt be brought in the name of the Husband only, 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 5.

               <p>As to ſuch things which concern the perſon of the Wife immediately, there the Writ muſt be brought in both their names; And therefore,</p>

               <p>The Husband and the Wife ſhall both bring an Action of Treſpaſs for the taking away the Goods of the Wife before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>In a Writ of <hi>Detinue of Chartres</hi> againſt Husband and Wife, Declaration was upon a <hi>Trover,</hi> and the Writ was abated. 13 <hi>R. 2. Breif</hi> 644.</p>
               <p>A Writ of <hi>Covenant</hi> was brought by the Husband and Wife, for that the Defendant had Leaſed to them Lands by Deed for Term of years, and afterwards ouſted them; and the Writ was adjudged to be good; for if the Husband dyes, the Wife ſhall have the Term, and in this Caſe they were both parties to the Covenant. 47 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Action of Debt</hi> for the arrearages of Rent reſerved upon a Leaſe for years made unto the Husband and the Wife, ſhall be brought againſt them both; and ſo ſhall a Writ of <hi>Waſt:</hi> for the Wife cannot waive the Leaſe during the life of the Husband. 6 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 10 &amp; 17 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>An Action upon the Statute of Laborers was brought againſt Husband and Wife, ſuppoſing that the Wife had Covenanted with the Plaintiff to be waiting-woman to his Wife for a year, and that ſhe departed

               <p>A man may have a writ of <hi>Detinue</hi> of Charters and of Chattels joyntly, becauſe there one thing is the ground of the Action, <hi>viz.</hi> the Deteyner. 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 41 Breif 583.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe a man may have a writ of Debt where part of the Debt is due by Obligation and part by Contract, becauſe there the Debt is only occaſion of the ſuit. 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age 75. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
               <p>So in things of the like nature one writ may comprehend many wrongs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Action of the Caſe was brought for hindring the Plaintiff to hold his Leet, 2. for the diſturbance of his Servants and Tenants in the gathering his Tithe, 3. for Threatning ſo that the people &amp;c. durſt not come to a certain Chappel to do their Devotion, and preſent their Offerings, &amp; 4. for the taking of his Servants and Chattels. 19 <hi>R.</hi> 2.

Secondly, Though the Church be ſo void, for not Reading, as a Pariſhoner may plead it againſt the Parſon, in Debt for the Tithes; yet the Patron is not to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice before it be given.

                  <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> the Defendant pleads, that he had been in 6 Months, and traverſes the Avoidance; Iſſue of it: Jury find for the Plaintiff, and enquire of the three points: Firſt, That the Church was full of <hi>J.

Thirdly, That the Action was brought within ſix Months after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance, and Judgment, <hi>quaer',</hi> and Writ to the Biſhop, to admit his Clerk nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Plaintiff by <hi>J. S.</hi> pending the Writ, and reſolved in Error on it, firſt at <hi>Common Law,</hi> if an Uſurper preſented, and had his Clerk admitted and inſtituted, the plenarty ſhall be tried by Certificate, becauſe no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, the Patron had loſt his preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <hi>pro hac vice;</hi> for the Clerk could not be removed, and was put to his Writ of Right for the <hi>Advowſon;</hi> but at <hi>Common Law,</hi> the King might remove the Incumbent of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper by a <hi>Quare Impedit;</hi> for <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi;</hi> but could not preſent: No removing him without <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. Then comes the Statute, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes the Infant, and Feme Covert, that they ſhould not be bound by an Uſurper; but after the Diſability removed, they may have the ſame Action the laſt Anceſtor might have had. <hi>Eadem Lex,</hi> if Tenant in Tail, in <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> by Courteſie or for Life ſuffer an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, he in Reverſion claiming by Deſcent has the ſame remedy: So in caſe of Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in time of Vacancy of a Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Statute reveſts not the Right; but gives a poſſeſſory Action, to recover the preſentation thereof. Where one uſurped on an Infant, who at Age Aliened the Mannor, his Alienee could have no Action for the next Avoidance, becauſe the <hi>Advowſon</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not, nor had himſelf any Remedy after; but where Tenant for years brought <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and was barred, yet it barred not the Right of him that had the Freehold. Secondly, it makes plenarty no Barr in <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Impedit,</hi> or Aſſiſe <hi>de darrein.</hi> Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if brought within half a year after the Avoidance, though not ſo ſoon ended.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64030:100"/> Thirdly, It gives Damages. Infants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by purchaſe are not within the firſt, and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of Tayl is within the Equity of the firſt Branch: becauſe Tayl made the ſame Parl. which divided the Eſtate, and takes away his Writ of Right at Common Law, the three points were not enquirable; but now they are <hi>ex officio</hi> at the Common Law. No Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff recovers Damage, nor the King now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not within the Statute, which was made to help them that loſt the preſentment. <hi>Si tempus ſemeſtr' tranſivit,</hi> which the King did not; yet the Declaration for the King ever counts for Damages at the Common Law, if the Defendant preſent <hi>pend'</hi> the Writ, his Eſtate was to be removed: So if a Stranger uſurp, <hi>pend'</hi> the Writ; and in all caſes, he that came in pending the Writ, if not by good Title, though by preſentment from the King; and ſince the Statute no Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent made before the Writ ſhall be removed by it, unleſs named in it, and in the caſe at Bar reſolved the Incumbent that came in <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente lite,</hi> is to be removed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Writ is to be to the Biſhop, to admit the Plaintiffs Clerk, and he cannot return plenarty; and then the parties ſhall try it between themſelves <hi>viz.</hi> if he that came in <hi>pend' lite,</hi> had good title he ſhall ſtay, elſe be removed; but in <hi>Cro. rep.</hi> of this caſe, 2, <hi>part</hi> 33.
